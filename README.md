# SOLID Principles

This repository contains my TypeScript examples to illustrate the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. Each principle is demonstrated in a separate folder:

## 1. Single Responsibility

This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. The example demonstrates how to create classes with a single responsibility and avoid violating this principle.

## 2. Open-Closed

This principle suggests that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. The example shows how to use abstract classes, interfaces, and design patterns to achieve a system that is easily extensible without modifying existing code.

## 3. Liskov Substitution

This principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. The TypeScript example illustrates how to design classes to adhere to this principle, promoting code reliability and maintainability.

## 4. Interface Segregation

This principle suggests that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. The example shows how to create cohesive and focused interfaces to avoid unnecessary dependencies between classes.

## 5. Dependency Inversion

This principle emphasizes that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but rather both should depend on abstractions. The example demonstrates how to use dependency injection and inversion of control to achieve a flexible and maintainable codebase.
